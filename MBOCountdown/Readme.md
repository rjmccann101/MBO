# MBO

This data field is intended for use during MBO events (see <https://www.bmbo.org.uk/>).
Add it to a screen on the MTB activity and start the activity as you start the event.
It provides a countdown with 30 minute alerts until there are 30 minutes left then
5 minute alerts for the last half hour and 1 minute alerts for the last 5 minutes.

The default event duration is 3 hours but this can be configured to be between
1 and 5 hours (inclusive) by changing the **Event Duration** property.
This value can be set in Garmin Express or Garmin Connect.

When time is up it starts showing you the number of points that your losing until,
if your having a really bad day, you have lost all points.

Each of the periods has its own alert tone which it plays once, it then plays a
repeated beep with the number of repeats showing the number of periods you have used,
so a thirty minute alert followed by three beeps means that you have used three
thirty minute periods, half of the time, while a five minute alert followed by
3 beeps will be played when there are 10 minutes left.
